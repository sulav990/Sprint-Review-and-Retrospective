# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I start by really listening to what the user wants and understanding the “why” behind it. It’s not just about what features they ask for—it’s about the problem they’re trying to solve. Creating user stories makes this so much easier because it breaks down those needs into clear, simple goals. For example, when the Product Owner suggested the personalized itinerary feature for the SNHU Travel app, turning that into a user story helped us focus on the value it would bring to the user. It gave the team a clear target and made sure we were building something that truly mattered.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I like to approach development one step at a time, building small pieces that work and then improving as we go. Agile fits perfectly with that mindset because it’s all about flexibility and collaboration. During the SNHU Travel project, using Scrum helped us adapt quickly when things changed, like when we had to update the destinations display on short notice. In the future, I definitely want to keep using sprints, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives. These keep everyone aligned and make it easier to deliver quality work without feeling overwhelmed.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

For me, being a good team member means communicating openly, owning your work, and stepping up to help when someone is stuck. It’s also about being adaptable and staying positive, even when things don’t go as planned. On the SNHU Travel team, this really showed during our stand-ups—everyone shared progress honestly and offered help when needed. That kind of teamwork made the project not just successful, but enjoyable. A good team member doesn’t just focus on their own tasks—they help make sure the whole team succeeds.
